**Docker Flask Postgres NGinx configuration**

 * From https://testdriven.io/blog/dockerizing-flask-with-postgres-gunicorn-and-nginx/

 Follow this instruction to install and run:

 First make sure to have docker and docker-compose installed on your local computer : https://docs.docker.com/install/
 (Note no docker ce support for last ubuntu version, so I used the previous one like descried here : https://github.com/docker/for-linux/issues/833)

Maybe adapt version
version: '3.7' in the docker compose I used mine
